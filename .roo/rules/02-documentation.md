# ⭐⑵✅Always Consult Latest Documentation

When writing or modifying code, you MUST always refer to the latest official documentation for the languages, frameworks, libraries, and tools relevant to the current task or codebase. This ensures accuracy, adherence to best practices, and awareness of any recent changes or deprecations.

To do this:
1.  Identify the specific language, framework, library, or tool for which documentation is needed based on the current context.
2.  If you know the official documentation URL, prioritize using it.
3.  If the official URL is unknown or needs verification, use the `fetch` MCP tool to search for the official documentation website. For example, you might search for "official [name] documentation" where [name] is the technology in question.
4.  Always prioritize official sources over unofficial blogs or forums, though the latter can be helpful for specific troubleshooting if official sources are insufficient.
5.  For Roo Code itself, the official documentation is at [`https://docs.roocode.com/`](https://docs.roocode.com/).
